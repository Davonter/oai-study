# PDCCH

From LTE specification the PDCCH carries the Downlink Control Information (DCI)

The DCI encoding have the following steps:

1. CRC Attachment
2. Channel Coding
3. Rate Maching

The encoded DCI is modulated with the following steps:

1. Multiplexing and Scrambling
2. QPSK Modulation
3. Layer Mapping
4. Precoding
5. Resource Mapping
